# Build Journal
## Time - 2 hours

### Day 1 - 0.5
I printed out my CAD today, and even though switches fit into it, I didn't like how bulky it was. While looking at it in-person I realized how much I can cut down on excess material so I reprinted another version that was way slimmer.

### Day 2 - 0.5
Today the PCB arrived so I started by soldering the diodes. At first, my work was really bad but I realized that if I use pliers to pull the diode in a lot and then bend the extra metal up, they don't move around which makes it a lot easier to solder.

### Day 3 - 1
All that was left was soldering in the switches and oled, which went pretty smoothly. Then I had to test and debug the code. At first it wasn't working but I realized the issue was a missing import was crashing it. Also I kept having an annoying issue where it wouldn't give me write permissions which slowed me down a lot.
